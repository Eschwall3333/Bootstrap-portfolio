                <p>Welcome welcome my friends to this short paragraph of just who I am.  As I said above, my name is Emory Schwall.  I'm a dude of many many interests and tastes.  For starters, I've always been madly in love with music, electronic music in particular.  Ever since I saw a music video for one of Daft Punk's first tracks when I was four years old, I've been hooked.  Since then I've not only been obsessed with listening to music but creating it and studying it as well. </p>

                <p> When I was ten I begged my parents for a guitar which is where I started learning how to play jazz.  Not to long after that I got pretty bored and wanted desperately to learn how to build a guitar.  A few electronics lessons from my father and tons of frustration later, I built my first "franken guitar" which I still have to this day. My love for building guitars though soon spiraled out of control into tons and tons of different avenues like synthesizers, dirtbikes, cars, speakers, and (now as an adult, homeowner and soon to be married man) things like furtinture and lighting fixtures.  </p>

                <p>Beyond my extreme love for creating, building and modifying things, I love to cook, race cars, race motorcycles, travel and do anything I can, when I can, to create my own place in this world.  I've never really been much of a follower and I don't ever intend to be.  I surround myself wit hindividuals who are, themselves, leaders...or at least very much so their own person.  I'm by no means an introvert but I do have a serious distaste for, as harsh as it may sound, stupid people. </p>
